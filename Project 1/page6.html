      <p>This is the most infuriating argument of all, as it generalizes gamers
        and invalidates the tastes of others. Often, games will lock “flavor”
        items like toys, appearances, and other features that don’t affect the
        gameplay behind a paywall. The argument here is that if it doesn’t
        affect your ability to fight, navigate, or solve problems, then it’s not
         important. Well like I said before: if these items had no value they
         wouldn’t be selling them; clearly, they matter to someone.</p>
        <p>People play games for different reasons. Some people just want to
          shoot monsters. Some want to explore to a unique environment. Others
          want to engage with a compelling story, to immerse themselves in a
          virtual world. You can’t place an objective value on any of this.</p>
          <p>All that fun, “useless,” “flavor” content serves to make the game
            more diverse, enjoyable, and immersive for many gamers. For some,
            atmosphere and immersion are just as important as pure gameplay.
            Cosmetics, in particular, can enhance a gamer’s experience. They
            can be a sign of hard work, a sign of experience and status among
            your peers. They can be a memento of past experiences, a reward for
            completing a difficult task. Cosmetics are often rare collectibles
            earned by exploring every nook and cranny of the game-world.
            <a href="page7.html"> All of
            this is lost when you lock them behind a paywall. </a></p>
