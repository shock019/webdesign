    <h1><div class="Quote1">“Publishers Are Too Poor To Make Games Without Microtransactions”</div></h1>
      <p>Never believe a word of this. The cry of poverty is the biggest lie of all.
      The majority of American game companies are making millions dodging taxes.
      I have a hard time believing they’re too poor to make games without double
      or triple dipping.</p>
        <p>If companies are losing money, then it’s because of their
          over-bloated budgets and hilarious lack of business acumen. We’re
          living in an age where every big budget game can decimate a company if
          it doesn’t make massive profits. Publishers will accept nothing less
          than exponential profits, and that leads to the overpriced,
          over-produced, underdeveloped games we see again and again. The cost
          for “failure” is so high because of their own actions. These bloated
          budgets necessitate the predatory behavior we see in the industry.
