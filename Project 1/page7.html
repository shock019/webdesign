    <h1>Where This Argument Takes Us</h1>
      <p>Look at a game like WORLD OF WARCRAFT for example. There’s a small cash
        shop, but the vast majority of “flavor” items like mounts, cool-looking
        gear and “toy” items are earned in the game itself. There are 343 free
        mounts and, thousands of pets, and countless unique pieces of gear. Many
        of these are difficult to find or require a large amount of time and
        skill to acquire. They’re an integral part of the game, even if they
        have no effect on the actual gameplay.</p>
        <p>Can you imagine a world where every mount beyond a basic horse was
          locked behind a paywall? Can you imagine if a weapon’s appearance
          could only be unlocked with a $0.99 purchase? It would strip away a
          huge part of the game’s identity: earning cool and strange new items
          and the feeling of satisfaction you get showing them off.</p>
          <p>Now, the obvious counter-argument here is that WORLD OF WARCRAFT is
            a subscription-style MMO. In one way or another, you’re paying for
            these items. But you’re not paying for cosmetics alone. You’re
            paying for servers, regular updates, and more content than several
            games combined. It’s this sense of value that AAA publishers are
            missing.</p>
