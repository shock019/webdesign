    <h1>The Point</h1>
      <p>The overuse of microtransactions is one of the most pressing issues in
        the industry. As bad as it’s gotten lately, it’s clear this is just the
        beginning. Companies like Bethesda, WB, 2K, and countless others are
        testing the waters. They want to see how much they can get away with.</p>
        <p>They’re testing their boundaries and the limits of consumer patience.
          At what point do we respond? At what point does the market falter, as
          sales decrease and games collapse under the weight of their own greed?
          I don’t know, but the market can’t sustain itself like this.
          <a href="index.html">One way
          or another, we’re going to reach a breaking point, and I hope it
          happens sooner rather than later.</a></p>
