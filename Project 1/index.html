    <h1>There is Never A Good Reason To Put Microtransactions in a $60,
      Singleplayer Game</h1>
      <p>For better or worse, microtransactions are a permanent facet of the
        gaming industry. Despite the optimism of some consumers, who assumed

        free-to-purchase titles, it is clear they’ve overtaken the market.
        Now, microtransactions are not inherently a bad thing. In “free-to-play”
        games, they’re used in place of a traditional purchase price. In

        developers to support a game long after it is released.
