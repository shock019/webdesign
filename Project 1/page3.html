    <h1>There is Never A Good Reason To Put Microtransactions in a $60,
      Singleplayer Game</h1>
      <p>Put simply, there’s never a good reason to put microtransactions in a
        full-priced singleplayer game. It’s never good for the consumer, and yet
         I’m stunned at the amount of people that defend this practice. In this
         article, I want to dispel the most common myths I see about
         microtransactions. I want to take the very arguments I’ve seen from
         publishers and consumers alike, and explain why they’re nonsense..</p>
        <p>So, what’s wrong with microtransactions in $60 games? Why shouldn’t
          we accept them as a permanent facet of the industry? What’s wrong
          with the arguments supporting this practice?
