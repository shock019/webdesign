    <h1>There Are Better Ways To Serve The Consumer</h1>
      <p>Another facet of this argument is the idea that microtransactions
        aren’t designed for “hardcore” players; they’re for people who want an
        easier experience or are having trouble beating the game. In an
        interview with Eurogamer, Bob Roberts had this to say on the
        microtransactions in SHADOW OF WAR:</p>
        <p class="Quote"> "…it's there as a player choice. It's there, from my
          perspective, for people who are protective of their spare time and
          scared when a massive game comes along that they're not getting to
          see the full experience.”</p>
        <p>With this in mind, consider the following: If there’s value in
          skipping content, or fast-tracking the player through the gameplay,
          then it’s probably not good gameplay. If anything, the gameplay is
          likely designed around these microtransactions, forcing the player to
          grind through boring, repetitive tasks, or spend a few bucks to get
          what they want immediately. Sure, this isn’t always the case, but the
          sheer nature of business incentivizes companies to do this. They
          wouldn’t be doing their job if they didn’t try, in some way, to urge
          you to buy their product.</p>
