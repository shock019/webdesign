      <p>This is the most common, and most easily defeated argument I’ve seen.
        On the surface, it makes sense. Most microtransactions come in the form
        of items already available in the game or serve to speed you through the
        gameplay toward an individual goal. Loot boxes, for example, are a
        glorified form of gambling that allows you to spend money for the chance
        to get a useful item without earning it through the gameplay. This type
        of microtransaction has become increasingly popular over the years, and
        many defend them because you don’t need to use them to enjoy the game.
        According to this argument, so long as the item is available in the
        game, or has no effect on the gameplay, then why should we care if you
        can buy them?</p>
        <p>Well, whenever we talk about microtransactions, it’s important to
          keep two things in mind:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>They wouldn’t have made these microtransactions if they didn’t
            expect people to buy them.</li>
          <li>They wouldn’t expect people to buy them if they thought they
            didn’t have value.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>With this in mind, consider the following: If there’s value in
          skipping content, or fast-tracking the player through the gameplay,
          then it’s probably not good gameplay. If anything, the gameplay is
          likely designed around these microtransactions, forcing the player to
          grind through boring, repetitive tasks, or spend a few bucks to get
          what they want immediately. Sure, this isn’t always the case, but the
          sheer nature of business incentivizes companies to do this.
          <a href="page5.html"> They
          wouldn’t be doing their job if they didn’t try, in some way, to urge
          you to buy their product. </a></p>
