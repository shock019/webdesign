    <h1>There is Never A Good Reason To Put Microtransactions in a $60,
      Singleplayer Game</h1>
      <p>...that’s not the world we live in. The industry is completely
        incapable of moderation, entirely devoid of shame or self-reflection.
        They took what could have been a revolutionary pricing model and
        corrupted it into the nickel-and-dime, casino-style scam we know today.</p>
        <p>But most concerning is when microtransactions end up in singleplayer,
           full-priced games. These aren’t games that require ongoing support at
           high costs. These aren’t free games that need an additional source of
           revenue.
        <a href="page3.html">These are games we purchase for $60, with the expectation
        that they’ll be more or less complete. </a></p>
